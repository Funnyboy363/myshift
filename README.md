### RESTful CRUD Node Server

Server Install Process

npm install

npm start (or) nodemon app.js


## How to use

When in the app, only the page "Employees should currently show (As of Feb 23 2020). This displays shifts of employees for a potential company that would use the app. There is a potential button to request for shift cover, but that button is not currently functional.
 When logged in, the HR Manager (or supervisor) clicks on "Create Shift" to make one for an employee for that week. In the "Review Shift" page, the manager can edit the shift or delete it.
